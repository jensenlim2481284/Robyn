## 3.7.0
07-27-2022
- **Recode**: got rid of data.table dependency for r2py wrapper and removed all `globalVariables` associated noise
- **Recode**: all code is now clean and formatted under the tidyverse code style for better code reading and standardization
- **Feat**: trimmed functionality for response curves on one-pagers outputs to have coherent ranges plotted
- **Feat**: enabled channels removal on `robyn_allocator()` by setting their constraints to 0 #411
- **Feat**: when manually selecting refresh models in `robyn_refresh()`, re-ask user until valid solID is provided, instead of crashing
- **Feat**: new `plot` and improved `print` methods for `robyn_refresh()` outputs
- **Feat**: include time units used in adstock plots for clarity
- **Feat**: enabled organic media variables to be calibrated (no spend)
- **Fix**: when best model based on minimum combined errors was tied with other models, inconsistent outputs (one-pagers / clustering). Standardized combined errors methodology with new `errors_scores()` function, especially normalizing errors before filtering models. The largest the "error_score", the better the model's performance #428
- **Fix**: show blue dots on top of grey dots in Pareto plots #420
- **Fix**:  positive/negative colour palette on waterfall plot when all values are positive
- **Fix**:  set prophet's print as disabled when prophet_vars input is NULL (off)
- **Docs**: added CRAN, site, and FB group badges on README files
- **Docs**: several typos and documentation updates

## 3.6.3
06-5-2022
CRAN Version, Site & Documentation Revamp, More Inputs Flexibility...

* **CRAN**: First Robyn version available via CRAN. From now on, install CRAN's for stable version, GitHub's for dev version.
* **Docs**: Site revamp [#372](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/pull/372), documentation updates and demo enrichment
* **Feat**: Added `version_prompt` parameter to robyn_refresh() [#375](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/pull/375)
* **Feat**: Added new calibration checks to ensure quality experiments usage
* **Feat**: New `date_min` and `date_max` parameters on `robyn_allocator()` to pick non-0 means window
* **Feat**: New `robyn_update()` function
* **Feat**: More checks and warnings included to push users to follow best practices.
* **Refactor**: Changed 1 to 3 Pareto fronts as default to enrich `robyn_clusters()` results
* **Refactor**: Changed default thresholds on `robyn_converge()` to be more flexible
* **Fix**: Several bugs squashed

## 3.6.2
31-3-2022
Allocation and plot improvements, new warnings, bugs fixed

Relevant changes on v3.6.2:
- **Viz**: removed redundant information on plots and standardized styles and contents on all visualizations.
- **Feat**: new `date_min` and `date_max` parameters on `robyn_allocator()` to pick specific date range to consider mean spend values ([user request](https://www.facebook.com/groups/robynmmm/permalink/1072870463481086)).
- **Feat**: new `plot` methods for `robyn_allocator()` and `robyn_save()` outputs, and `print` method for `robyn_inputs()` with and without hyperparameters.
- **Feat**: provide recommendations on calibration inputs depending on the experiments' confidence, spending, and KPI measured [#307](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/issues/307).
- **Feat**: warn and avoid weekly trend input when data granularity is larger than "week".
- **Fix**: issues on several `robyn_allocator()` specific cases ([#349](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/issues/349), [#344](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/issues/344), [#345](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/issues/345)), especially when some coefficients were 0.
- **Fix**: bug with Weibull adstock scenario [#353](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/issues/353).
- **Docs**: fixed some typos, updated, and standardized internal documentation.

## 3.6.0
22-2-2022

What's New in v3.6.0

- New **hyperparameter "lambda"** finds MOO-optimal lambda and thus removes the need of manual lambda selection.
- New optional **hyperparameter `penalty.factor`** that further extends hyperparameter spaces and thus potentially better fit.
- New **optimisation convergence rules & plots** for each objective function showing if set iterations have converged or not (NRMSE, DECOMP.RSSD, and MAPE if calibrated)
- Improved **response function** now also returns the response for exposure metrics (response on imps, GRP, newsletter sendings, etc) and plots. Note that argument names and output class has changed. See updated `demo.R` for more details.
- More **budget allocation stability** by defaulting fitting media variables from `paid_media_vars` to `paid_media_spends`. Spend exposure fitting with Michaelis Menten function will only serve `robyn_response()` function output and plotting. `robyn_allocator()` now only relies on direct spend - response transformation.
- Default **beta coefficient signs**: positive for paid & organic media and unconstrained for the rest. Users can still set signs manually.
- New **print methods** for `robyn_inputs()`, `robyn_run()`, `robyn_outputs()`, and `robyn_allocator()` outputs to enable visibility on each step's results and objects content.
