### What is Robyn?
Robyn is an experimental, **semi-automated and open-sourced Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) package** from Meta Marketing Science.
It uses various machine learning techniques (Ridge regression, multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for hyperparameter optimisation, time-series decomposition for trend & season, gradient-based optimization for budget allocation etc.) to define media channel efficiency and effectivity, explore adstock rates and saturation curves.
Robyn is built for granular datasets with many independent variables and therefore especially suitable for digital and direct response advertisers with rich data sources.
